# SpaceX Capstone Project

In this project, I created a comprehensive dataset using web scraping, performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python and SQL, and built various dashboards using Dash and Plotly. Additionally, I created visualizations with Seaborn and Folium, and developed predictive models, where I trained, tested, and tuned them for optimal performance.

## Requirements

Before running the application, ensure the following Python packages are installed:

```bash
pip install dash
pip install plotly
pip install seaborn
pip install folium
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

These libraries are required for data scraping, analysis, and building the dashboards.

## Web Scraping

I used web scraping techniques to collect data for the project. Specifically, I scraped SpaceX launch data from publicly available websites to create a dataset that includes launch information such as:

- Launch date
- Rocket type
- Launch site
- Mission details
- Outcome of the launch

The dataset was cleaned, processed, and prepared for further analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

I performed EDA using both Python (via Pandas, Seaborn) and SQL. This allowed me to uncover key trends and patterns within the dataset. The EDA included:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualizations of launch success rates
- Distribution analysis of rocket types and launch sites
- Exploration of relationships between different launch variables

## Dashboards and Visualizations

### Dashboards

I created interactive dashboards using Dash and Plotly. These dashboards allow users to explore:

- A line chart showing the number of successful launches over time.
- A bar chart showing launches by rocket type.
- A pie chart displaying the distribution of launches by site.
- A map visualization using Folium to plot launch sites.

### Visualizations

I utilized Seaborn and Folium to create a series of visualizations, including:

- Heatmaps to visualize correlations between various features.
- Scatter plots to examine relationships between rocket type and launch success.
- Maps showing the geographical locations of launch sites with Folium.

## Predictive Models

I created predictive models to forecast the outcome of future SpaceX launches. The process included:

1. **Data Preparation**: Feature engineering and handling missing data.
2. **Model Training**: I used various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
3. **Model Testing**: I tested the models on a separate test set to evaluate performance.
4. **Model Tuning**: I used techniques like cross-validation and grid search to optimize model hyperparameters.

## How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Run the following commands in the terminal or in a Jupyter notebook cell to install the necessary packages:

```bash
%pip install dash
%pip install plotly
%pip install seaborn
%pip install folium
%pip install pandas
%pip install numpy
%pip install scikit-learn
%pip install requests
%pip install beautifulsoup4
```

### Step 2: Run the Web Scraping Script

Run the web scraping script to collect the latest SpaceX launch data:

```bash
python scrape_data.py
```

This will create the dataset used for further analysis.

### Step 3: Run the Dash App

To start the interactive dashboards, execute the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start a local server, and the dashboard will be accessible in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8090`.
