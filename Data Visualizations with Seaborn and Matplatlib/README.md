## Project Description
This project utilizes Seaborn's capabilities to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize data insights. Seaborn, built on top of Matplotlib, offers a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics, making it ideal for data exploration and presentation.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilizes Seaborn's tools for understanding data distributions and relationships.
- **Visualization Techniques**: Includes scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, histograms, and more to visualize data insights.
- **Integration with Pandas**: Seamlessly works with Pandas DataFrames for efficient data manipulation and visualization.

## File Formats
- Python scripts (.py)
- Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)

## Keywords
