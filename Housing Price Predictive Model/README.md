# Housing Price Predictive Models

## Overview
This project focuses on developing machine learning models to predict housing prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. By leveraging Python and popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, this project provides a comprehensive approach to housing price estimation.

## Project Description
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to create predictive models for housing prices. The models are trained on a dataset that includes features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and amenities. The goal is to provide accurate price predictions that can aid in informed decision-making for buyers, sellers, and real estate investors.

## Features
- **Regression Models**: Utilizes linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting (e.g., XGBoost) to predict housing prices.
- **Feature Engineering**: Includes techniques for selecting and transforming relevant features to enhance model accuracy.
- **Data Visualization**: Employs Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing data distributions and relationships.

## File Formats
- Python scripts (.py)
- Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)
- CSV files (.csv) for dataset storage

## Keywords
housing prices, real estate, regression model, machine learning, Python

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/hparker6/housing-price-predictive-models.git```

## Models Included
- **Linear Regression**: Basic model for predicting prices based on linear relationships.
- **Decision Trees**: Models that use tree-like structures to predict prices.
- **Random Forests**: Ensemble models combining multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**: Advanced model for handling complex interactions between features.
