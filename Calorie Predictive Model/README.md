# Calorie Predictive Model

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict caloric values based on food attributes. The model was developed using Python and trained on a labeled dataset of food items.

## Features
- Predicts caloric values of food items
- Utilizes machine learning techniques
- Developed in Python
- Trained on a comprehensive food dataset

## Date Created
November 9, 2024

## Author
Houston Parker

## File Formats
- Python (.py) - For model implementation
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) - For model training and testing
- CSV (.csv) - For storing the food dataset

## Keywords
machine learning, predictive model, calories, nutrition data, Python

## Project Files
- `calorie_model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for training and testing the calorie prediction model
- `data.csv`: Dataset containing food items and caloric values used to train the model
